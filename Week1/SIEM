Security Information and Event Management(SIEM) 
It is an umbrella term for security software packages ranging from Log Management Systems to Security Event Management.

While a SIEM system isn't a foolproof, it's one if the key indicators that an organization has a clearly defined cybersecurity policy.

Nine times out of ten, cyber attacks don't have any clear tells on a surface level. To detect threats, it's more effective to use the log files.
The superior log management capabilities of SIEMs have made them a central hub of network transparency.

SIEM's basic capabilities-
1. Log Collection
2. Normalization- Collecting logs and normalizing them into a standard format.
3. Notifications and Alerts- Notifying the user when security threats are identified.
4. Security threat Detection
5. Threat response workflow- Workflow for handling past security events.

SIEM records data from across a users' internal network of tools and identifies potential issues and attacks.
The system operates under a stastistial model to analyze log entries. SIEM distributes collection agens and recallls data from the network, devices, and firewalls.

All this information is then passed to a management console where it can be analyzed to address emerging threats.
It's common for advanced SIEM systems to use automated responses, entity behavior analytics and security orchestrations. 
This ensures that vulnerabilities between cybersecurity tools can be monitored and addressed by SIEM technology.

Once the necessary information reaches the management console, it is then viewed by a data analyst who can provide feedback on the overall process. This is important because
feedback helps to educate the SIEM system in terms of machine learning and increasing its familiarity with the surrounding environment. 

Once the SIEM software system identifies a threat, it then ommunicates with other security systems on the device to stop the unwanted activity.
